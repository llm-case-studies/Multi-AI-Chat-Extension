Whitepaper: Multi-AI Chat Webhook Extension
Abstract
The Multi-AI Chat Webhook Extension is a browser-based tool designed to bridge AI chat interfaces like DeepSeek with external systems via webhooks. By monitoring DOM changes in real-time, it extracts and forwards conversation data in a standardized JSON format, enabling integration with multi-AI workflows, logging services, or custom applications. This facilitates seamless data flow between isolated AI platforms, supporting use cases like conversation archiving, analysis, or proxying to other models.
Purpose and Motivation
AI chat tools like DeepSeek provide powerful natural language interfaces but often lack native export or integration options. This extension addresses that by:

Capturing bidirectional exchanges (user inputs and AI responses).
Sending data to a webhook for processing (e.g., aggregation in a multi-AI dashboard).
Maintaining privacy and efficiency with client-side execution.

In a multi-AI ecosystem, this allows chaining responses across models—e.g., forwarding DeepSeek outputs to another AI for refinement.
Architecture

Manifest and Permissions: Defined in manifest.json; uses "storage" for webhook persistence.
Options UI: options.html/js for user-configurable webhook URL.
Content Script (deepseek_chat_monitor.js): Injected into https://chat.deepseek.com/. Uses MutationObserver to watch the chat container (.conversation) for new nodes. Classifies messages via .message-user and .message-bot, extracts text, and POSTs JSON payloads.
Data Flow: User/Assistant Message → DOM Mutation → Observer Trigger → Payload Construction → Fetch POST to Webhook.
Error Handling: Logs issues like missing containers or failed requests; observer cleans up on unload.

Use Cases

Logging/Analysis: Send chats to a server for sentiment analysis or storage.
Multi-AI Integration: Proxy DeepSeek responses to other AIs (e.g., via a server-side webhook handler).
Automation: Trigger external actions based on chat content (e.g., API calls).

Limitations and Future Work

Relies on stable DOM selectors; may break if DeepSeek updates UI.
One-way (send only); add receive/injection for full duplex.
No authentication; secure webhooks recommended.
Expand to other AI chats (e.g., add matches in manifest.json).

This tool empowers users to extend AI chats beyond silos, fostering innovative multi-AI applications.
